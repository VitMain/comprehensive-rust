# Welcome to Idiomatic Rust

[Rust Fundamentals](../welcome-day-1.md) introduced Rust syntax and core
concepts. We now want to go one step further: how do you use Rust _effectively_
in your projects? What does _idiomatic_ Rust look like?

This course is opinionated: we will nudge you towards some patterns, and away
from others. Nonetheless, we do recognize that some projects may have different
needs. We always provide the necessary information to help you make informed
decisions within the context and constraints of your own projects.
